# sigma_form

A simple form generator plugin element for the [Nitrogen Web Framework](http://nitrogenproject.com)

## Installing into a Nitrogen Application

Add it as a rebar dependency by adding into the deps section of rebar.config:

```erlang
	{sigma_form, ".*", {git, "git://github.com/choptastic/sigma_form.git", {branch, master}}}
```

### Using Nitrogen's built-in plugin installer (Requires Nitrogen 2.2.0)

Run `make` in your Application. The rest should be automatic.

### Manual Installation (Nitrogen Pre-2.2.0)

Run the following at the command line:

```shell
	./rebar get-deps
	./rebar compile
```

Then add the following includes into any module requiring the form

```erlang
	-include_lib("sigma_form/include/records.hrl").
```

## Usage

```erlang
	#sigma_form{data=PlayerData, fields=[
		{name, "Your name"},
		{email, "Your email Address"},
		{class, "Preferred Class", {dropdown, [
			{"D","Druid"},
			{"H"," Hunter"},
			{"B", "Bard"},
			{"F", "Fighter"}]}},
		{description, "Tell us about yourself", textarea}
	]},
	#button{text="Create Character", postback=create}
```

The `data` attribute can be any of the following:
  + A [proplist](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/proplists.html) containing the data.
  + A [dict](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/dict.html) containing the data.
  + A [map](http://www.erlang.org/doc/man/map.html) containing the data.
  + A function with arity 1. This function will be called for each field as
    `LookupFun(FieldName)`. For example, this could be used to retrieve a
    single field value from a database.

The format for the `fields` attribute is any of the following formats:

```erlang
	{Fieldid, Label},
	{Fieldid, Label, Type},
	{Fieldid, Label, Type, Options},
    #inline_group{header=HeaderBody, fields=Fields}
```

  + `Fieldid` will be the ID the generated element, and is also the key of the
    related data in the `data` attribute.
  + `Label` is just the text label for the element
  + `Type` is either the atoms `textbox`, `textarea`, `password`, `date`,
    `date_dropdown`, `yesno` or the following tuples `{dropdown, DropdownOptions}`
    or `{yesno, YesText, NoText}` or any acceptable value for an HTML input's
	`type` attribute
  + `Options`, is a proplist, which for most elements, only currently supports
    one option: `{placeholder, "Placeholder Text"}` and which only works on
	textboxes and textareas. For `date`, the `Options` proplist will be passed
	to the options attribute of the
	[`#datepicker_textbox`](http://nitrogenproject.com/doc/elements/datepicker_textbox.html)
  + `DropdownOptions` is a list of options which are acceptable as the `options`
    attribute of the [#dropdown](http://nitrogenproject.com/doc/elements/dropdown.html)
  + `#inline_group{}` as a field will initiate some tweaks to allow for an
    inline-group of element for use with bootstrap.

**Note:** If any item in the `fields` attribute does not match one of the above
formats, the value is passed through anyway.  This allows you to include more
elaborate controls or breaks that include just text, or anything in between.

**Note** `sigma_form` does not do any postbacks, buttons, or validations.
That is up to you.

## Miscellaneous Perks

### Class names
Each row will be wrapped in a div with a class set to
`sigma_form_field_FIELDNAME` where `FIELDNAME` is the ID of the field. This
will allow you to easily target the rows or elements with CSS or to hide/show
the rows dynamically.

### Quickly Get Field Name

There is a function `sigma_form:get_label(FieldName, Fields)` where
`Fields` is the same as the `Fields` value above and `FieldName` is the ID of
the field. It will return the label associated.  It's mostly a shortcut for
`lists:keyfind/3`, but with a more specific naming semantics meant to
accommodate `sigma_form`
